  <h2>Architecture Scope</h2>
<p>The scope of the Regional ITS Architecture can be described in terms of: 1) the size of the region and jurisdictions covered (geographic scope), 2) the planning or time horizon, and 3) the variety of transportation services that are covered.  This scope is defined in the context of adjacent and overlapping Regional ITS Architectures.</p>
<h3>Description</h3><p>The purpose of the Flint Hills Regional ITS Architecture is to illustrate and document the integration of regional ITS systems to allow planning and deployment to occur in an organized and coordinated process.  The Architecture helps guide the planning, implementation, and integration of ITS devices deployed and managed by multiple types of agencies that provide transportation services within the region.<br /><br />The Flint Hills Regional ITS Architecture provides a framework for institutional agreements and technical integration of ITS implementation projects in the region. It describes the "big picture" for ITS deployment in terms of individual ITS components that will perform the functions necessary to deliver the desired needs.  It supports effective and efficient deployment of transportation and ITS projects that address the transportation problems and needs in the region.<br /><br />The Architecture is a roadmap for the deployment and integration of transportation systems in the region over the next 10 years. The architecture has been developed through a cooperative effort by the transportation, transit, law enforcement, emergency management, commercial vehicle and freight management agencies. It represents a shared vision of how each agency's systems work together by sharing information and resources to enhance transportation safety, efficiency, capacity, mobility, reliability, and security.<br /><br />The current Metropolitan Transportation Plan is Connect 2050. C2050 is available to view here: https://www.flinthillsmpo.org/connect2050.</p><h3>Time Frame: 2025 &ndash; 2035 (10 years)</h3><h3>Geographic Scope</h3><p>The Flint Hills Region covers parts of Geary County, Pottawatomie County, and Riley County and the City of Junction City and the City of Manhattan.  The FHMPO was designated by the Kansas DOT in February 2013. In 2017, the Policy Board voted to expand the MPO boundary to include the City of Wamego and more of Pottawatomie County along the US&ndash;24 corridor; this boundary expansion took effect January 1, 2018. The Flint Hills Regional ITS Architecture covers the area within the FHMPO boundary.</p><h3>Service Scope</h3><p>Traffic management and operations, traveler information, public transportation management, incident management, emergency management, parking management, and maintenance and construction management</p><h3>Related Architectures</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Related Architecture</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Kansas Statewide ITS Architecture</th><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
