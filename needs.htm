  <h2>Needs</h2>
<p>The Stakeholders' Needs listed below are designed to answer two basic questions:<br />&ndash; What does the System(s) need to do?<br />&ndash; What do users need from the System(s)?<br /><br />They are written from the perspective of a system user or stakeholder in that system and are categorized by the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Service Packages that comprise the regional architecture.  Service Packages provide an accessible, service&ndash;oriented perspective to the overall system architecture used to describe the region or project.  They identify the pieces of the physical view that are required to implement a particular ITS service.  Each of these service packages has a set of Needs associated with it that can be used as the basis for stakeholder validation, setting proper expectations, and eliciting requirements for the systems and devices to be implemented.</p>
